# Job-Search

This application is developed for creating an interactive job vacancy for candidates. The objective of the application is to enable job seekers view a job on the portal and apply for the same. It is designed using the MVC architecture and maven tool as a build tool.

Objectives of the project :

* Registration
* Login
* Authenticating
* Updating Profile
* Posting/removing/modifying a job
* Searching for a job

Software Requirements:Â 

* Operating System: Windows
* User Interface: HTML, CSS
* Server-side: Servlet
* Client-side Scripting: JavaScript
* Programming Language: Java
* Web Applications: JDBC, JSP
* IDE/ Workbench: Eclipse
* Database: Oracle
* Server Deployment: Apache Tomcat 8.0

The system has two kinds of roles : the admin and the user (i.e job seekers). An admin can View/Add/Edit/Delete jobs in the system. 
Whereas, a user can register and view jobs on the portal. The user can also update any of the personal details at any given point of time. The user can also filter job search on the basis of location, job domain and whether the job is active or inactive in the system.

It is fully functional but I have to add more features to it such as job application and further processing of the same.
